		<h2>Release parties</h2>
		<p>After a new ownCloud release, community members around the world organize release parties! Usually that's just a meeting in a cafe or office with a 
			presentation of what is new in ownCloud 7 and time to chat about it. Release parties don't have to be done in the release week at all â€“ doing it a bit later
			gives everybody a chance to play with the release before the meeting!</p>
