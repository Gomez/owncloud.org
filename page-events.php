		<h2>Release parties</h2>
		<p>One of the best parts of an ownCloud release, are the community release parties! A release party can be a meeting in a cafe or office with a
			presentation of what is new in the latest ownCloud release and time to chat about it. Release parties don't have to be done in the release week at all – doing it a bit later
			gives everybody a chance to play with the release before the meeting.</p>
			<p>We hope you will come celebrate with us at a location listed below.</p>
