		<p>ownCloud community members all around the globe organize ownCloud presence at trade shows and conferences to present our community and technology. 
			You want to organize ownCloud attendance to an event? You're in the right place! Below you will find some practical tips on how to organize attendance 
			to an event as well as how to tell us about it and how to get some ownCloud goodies!</p>

		<h2>ownCloud at conferences and trade shows</h2>
		<p>As ownCloud appeals to both home users and businesses, we can be found at a wide variety of conferences and trade shows.</p>

		<h3>Giving a presentation or workshop</h3>
		<p>If you want to give a presentation or workshop on ownCloud, you can get some ideas for subjects and slides <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/promo">here</a>. There are also
			presentation templates which you can adapt to your needs.</p>

		<h2>Organizing a booth</h2>
		<p>Going to a trade show or conference for ownCloud is not hard. All you need are one or more volunteers and some positive energy!</p>

		<h3>Tell everybody about the booth!</h3>
		<p>Share the ownCloud attendance to the event over social media - set up an event page on Facebook and Google plus, ask people to share the news. </p>
			And tell us about it!</p>

		<h3>Setting up a booth</h3>
		<p>A crucial thing when setting up a booth is to create open space. This is very hard, as many events put a row of tables in front of the visitors 
			and it is of course easy to go and sit behind them. But that is hardly an effective strategy. Instead, put the table back against the wall if you 
			can, and stand in front. That is much nicer for visitors! Nobody likes to be the first person at a booth, and if you and your booth friends are 
			standing in front, it seems there is always something going on.</p>

		<p>Also, don't hack at the booth unless you are giving a workshop. It makes it seem very uninviting.</p>

		<p>On the other hand, having a screen with ownCloud in action is of course good - you can demo it to people! Having something 'interesting' happen 
			there is good, too. A video of ownCloud in action, for example. You can find some in our <a href="http://www.youtube.com/ownclouders">Youtube channel</a>.</p>

		<h3>Promoting the booth</h3>
		<p>Get people to the booth! You can put some leaflets or hang up some posters around the venue, and if you give a talk you should certainly 
			mention that there is an ownCloud booth.</p>

		<h3>Handling visitors</h3>
		<p>There are four kind of visitors you get at the booth: newbies, advanced users, business users and (potential) contributors. You're there to get 
			newbies interested in ownCloud, answer questions of the advanced users and convince the (potential) business users that their company needs 
			ownCloud! Last but not least, you should convince (potential) contributors to get on board with ownCloud hacking: it is fun and easy.</p>

		<p>To help you talk about ownCloud, we have a <a href="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri(); ?>/assets/files/FAQ.pdf">conference team FAQ</a> and some <a href="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri(); ?>/assets/files/TalkingPoints.pdf">conference talking points</a>. Print these pages,
			read them and bring them for the others on the booth to read in a quiet moment. Of course, use our flyers, posters and other materials. You 
			can <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/promo">download designs here</a> for modification and printing. To receive an envelop with stickers and flyers from us, <a href="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri(); ?>/assets/files/request_form.pdf">click here</a> for a request form to fill in. Note that we have limited supply and shipping and handling takes time, so ask us in time! In general, count on two weeks at least and please understand that currently we only ship in (most countries in) Europe and the USA.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Always approach people with a question: do you know ownCloud, do you use dropbox or Google drive, do you share files with other people... Find out 
			what their problem is and then tell them how ownCloud can help them. If they have no problem or ownCloud can't help, well, that's it. No 
			reason to make them listen to anything they won't be interested in, while you could be talking to people who DO need ownCloud!</p>

		<p>If you encounter negativity or users with problems, of course try to help them. But don't spend too much time on it - rather, ask them to ask on the forums 
			or on the mailing list. You sure won't be able to solve their complicated problem on the spot and there are lots of other people who want to hear about 
			ownCloud. Nothing is perfect, neither is ownCloud - but we are best at dealing with that online, rather than at events.</p>

		<p>Organize little talks or workshops at the booth. Like "building your first ownCloud app". They don't attract a lot of people, but that means you get 
			to spend some quality time with a few!</p>

		<h2>Getting some goodies</h2>
		<p>We can send you some materials like stickers and flyers for your booth. We have limited supply and shipping takes time, so ask us in time! <a href="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri(); ?>/assets/files/request_form.pdf">Click here</a> for a request
			form to fill in. Note that we have limited supply and shipping and handling takes time, so ask us in time! In general, count on two weeks at least and please understand that currently we only ship in (most countries in) Europe and the USA.</p>

		<h2>Telling us about it</h2>
		<p>It is great if you share what you did at the conference or trade show with the international community!</p>
