		<p>ownCloud community members all around the globe <a href="http://owncloud.meetup.com/">organize meetups</a> to get together, learn, share ideas and 
			work on ownCloud. These events are organized by ownCloud enthusiasts just like you. Want to organize such a meetup? You're in the right place!</p>

		<p>Our meetups come in all shapes and sizes, but all have one thing in common: they are organized by someone just like you. Below you will find some 
			practical tips on how to organize a great meetup as well as information on how to tell us about your meetup and how to get some ownCloud goodies!</p>

		<h2>Organizing</h2>
		<p>Organizing a meetup might seam like a big deal, but it doesn't have to be. All you really need are a room with power and wifi, some content and 
			wnClouders!</p>

		<h3>Where and when?</h3>
		<p>Often you can easily get a room at work, university, community center, local hacker space, hacker caf√© or a public library. Try to get something 
			for free, but if it really has to cost a little, we suggest you ask a donation from the participants or see if you can get a sponsor (like, your 
			employer perhaps?). Upfronting the money is cool, but you can't do that every month.</p>

		<p>We do many ownCloud meetups around 19:00 on week days, but if that does not work for you, try a weekend! And of course: just ask the participants 
			if another time would work better.</p>

		<h3>Tell everybody!</h3>
		<p>We use <a href="http://meetup.com">meetup.com</a> for most of our events. We have an account where we can set up meetups, so if you're up for 
			organizing one, let us know and</p>

		<p>Register, **find out process here** set up a page and you have a good start! Here is an <a href="http://www.meetup.com/owncloud-berlin/">example page</a>.</p>

		<p>Next up is to share it over social media - set up an event page on Facebook and Google plus, ask people to share the news. Don't feel bad if your first
			meeting attracts just 5 visitors and don't freak out if 30 RSVP. A small group means you each have time to really work together; and a big group 
			means everybody will talk to everybody so you don't have to worry about keeping everybody busy!</p>

		<h3>What to do at the event?</h3>
		<p>Now you have a place and some participants, but what to do? It is easiest to separate two kinds of meetups: the one where (potential) ownCloud 
			contributors come together; and one where users meet up.</p>

		<p><strong>Development Meetups</strong> need very little: room, wifi, people with laptops. Keep it simple: ownClouders will get along just fine. Open by doing
		a round of introductions, ask everybody to share what they would like to do. You can use one or more of our <a href="http://github.com/owncloud/promo">ready-made workshop presentations
		to get started</a> but if everybody just wants to get hacking: that's great!</p>

		<p>Of course, every now and then you could get an interesting speaker to discuss some Cloudy subject.</p>

		<p><strong>User Meetups</strong> require a little more work. It is usually best to, after introductions, have a presentation or demonstration - use a
		<a href="http://github.com/owncloud/promo">ready-made workshop or  presentation to get started</a>. After that, have room for questions and discussions.
		Be sure to announce the subject
		beforehand so people know what to expect, and solicit input: ideas, requests or offers for help. We offer content for a number of meetings but it is also 
		nice to encourage members of the meetup group to contribute their own knowledge and experience!</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<ul>
		    <li>It is nice to be welcome, so welcome newcomers! If your meetup gets big, you can ask somebody to help you welcoming new visitors...</li>
		    <li>get people to sign up on meeetup.com or ask for their mail addresses so you can tell them about the next meetup!</li>
		    <li> so ideally you get together some blabla, there is no financial support from ownCloud right now</li>
		    <li>Find people to help you. Try to organize the meetup with others so when you're on holiday, the event can still take place.</li>
		    <li>Remind people of the ownCloud code of conduct if they aren't nice to each other: you have every right to tell them to stay away if they can't behave...</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>ownCloud swag?</h3>
		<p>If you organize a meetup, we'd be happy to send you an envelope with some ownCloud stickers and other stuff to make your laptops look cloudy!
			Note that we have limited supply and shipping and handling takes time, so ask us in time! In general, count on two weeks at least and please understand that currently we only ship in (most countries in) Europe and the USA.. <a href="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri(); ?>/assets/files/request_form.pdf">Click here</a> for a request form to fill in.</p>
